Hello candidate,

You are to build a web app through which companies and organizations can onboard new recruits or teammembers with ease.

How will it work?

New teammmember provides the manager with their email id. The manager will input that email id into the web app and 
the teammember will get access to the organization's Github, Trello, folders in Google Drive, Slack. In similar way,
when the teammember leaves, with one click from the manager, their access will be revoked.

What you need to deliver

- [ ] UI design on Figma
- [ ] Frontend of the webapp using React-Redux
- [ ] (if needed) Backend in serverless framework
- [ ] Dockerize the app
- [ ] Make a pull request
- [ ] Documentation of the entire webapp

If you have questions, please state your assumptions on the documentation and proceed with development.

Happy hacking!
